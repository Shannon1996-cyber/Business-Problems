<h11 id="DisHead"> - Visual Impairments </h11>
<br><br>
People with low vision may suffer from extreme forms of short-sightedness or 
long-sightedness, or their vision may be blurred or unclear in other ways.
<br><br>
When interacting with websites people with low vision may typically need to 
do one or more of the following:
<br><br>
Adjust the size of the text on their browser
<br><br>
Use assistive software to magnify the web page
<br><br>
Override the style of web pages to use high contrast colour schemes
<br><br>
Use screen readers and/or braille display
<br><br>
<hr><hr>
<br><br>
<h11 id="DisHead">  - Blindness </h11>
<br><br>
Typically blind users will have extreme difficulty using websites as sighted 
people would. 
<br><br>
When interacting with websites people with blindness may typically 
need to do one or more of the following:
<br><br>
Use a screen reader
<br><br>
Use a braille display
<br><br>
<hr><hr>
<br><br>
<h11 id="DisHead">  - Motor impairments </h11>
<br><br>
impairments can affect the use of people upper limbs and hands – the way most 
people interact with a computer and web. 
<br><br>People with motor impairments may need to do one or more of the following to access the web:
<br><br>
Rely solely on keyboard interaction with web pages
<br><br>

<br><br>
Use voice recognition software
<br><br>

<br><br>

<h11 id="DisHead"> - Hearing impairments or deafness </h11>
<br><br>
Like blindness, deafness can manifest itself in infinite degree – from slight
 impairment to complete loss of sensation. 
 <br><br>
 The following features of web pages 
 can make life difficult for people with deafness (not an exhaustive list):
 <br><br>
Video content with no captioning
<br><br>
Audio content or signals with no captioning
<br><br>
Background noises too loud
<br><br>
Very complex and/or obscure language
