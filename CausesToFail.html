        <div class="box box1"> 
            
            <h6 id= textHeading> 
                1.
                <br>
                Misalignment with business processes:
                 </h6>
            
            
            <h7>
            Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user 
            experience, but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the
             company’s business processes, the initiative is very likely to fail.
              This often happens when teams put technology ahead of strategy, 
              falling for the hype of new innovative tools before considering 
              the business process implications of the new technology. Aligning
               digital and business goals and integrating new products seamlessly
                with business operations is critical to project success.</h7>

                        <br>
                        Lack of cross-functional expertise: 
                         </h6>
            
            
            
            <h7> Similar to
             number 1, there’s a common misconception that digital projects only 
             need “digital people.” But every digital project should have someone 
             with business process management skills to help scope and plan the 
             alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational 
             processes.</h7>

                Limited digital strategy:
                 </h6>
    <h7>  Many digital projects 
            are focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative,
             rather than contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy 
             and business goals. Define specifically what success looks like for
              the project and how it contributes to the company’s business strategy 
              before moving forward.</h7> 
        </div>

<div class="box box4"> <h6 id= textHeading> 
        4.
        <br>
        Fixed plans that don’t account for change:
         </h6>

    <h7>
     The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. Using Agile, iterative processes
             that allow for frequent tweaks and improvement is the only way to 
             ensure that success is lasting. Your digital project plans should be
              flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and 
              the market at any given moment.</h7> 
            </div>
            <br><br><br>

<div class="box box5">

    <h6 id= textHeading> 
        5.
        <br>
         Overambition: 
         </h6>

         <h7> Expecting perfection instead of
             embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result
              in projects that drag on way past their scope. Explore the idea of
               releasing “Minimum Viable Products,” or early versions of software
                that gauge how the market will respond and determine if the concept 
                is worth pursuing. Saying "Let’s launch a perfect site within the 
                next 3 months” without a real business plan is a sure path to 
                failure.</h7>
